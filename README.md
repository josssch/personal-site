# My Personal Website

This repository contains the source code to my personal portfolio website, hosted with GitHub Pages. See the [live version here](https://jossh.dev). This site features enough information to be considered a resume, including my skills, experience, and projects.

## Goal

My end goal behind this website is to showcase my capabilities in implementing responsive web design principles. Principles that are not always implemented in some interfaces since it sometimes becomes an after thought.

Along with that, I wanted a place to showcase my personal projects that I work on in my free time. Because a lot of my professional work remains private, I wanted to create a space where I could explain my public projects and the design goals behind them—as well as provide a central place to discover them.
